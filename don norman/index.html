        I wrote the book on user-friendly design. What I see today horrifies me
    </h1>

    <p>
        The world is designed against the elderly, writes Don Norman, 83-year-old author of the industry bible Design of Everyday Things and a former Apple VP.

        <h3>
            Summary
        </h3>
        <p>
            Humans are living longer and healthier than ever before. While certain functions do slow down with age, and humans aren&#39;t as capable as their younger selves, the aged population still works and travels. A major change highlighted by Norman over time is the diminishing of senses such as vision, hearing, taste, and most things physical. “Oldsters” are not a niche market and an important one at that, as they have more free time, experience and discretionary income than younger people. He feels the world is designing against the elderly. With everyday household goods becoming harder to handle (the physical products).
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to digital products, some complaints he has included,
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Companies insist on printing critical instructions in tiny fonts with very low contrast.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Labels cannot be read without flashlights and magnifying lenses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When companies design things specifically for the elderly, they tend to be ugly devices that shout out to the world <q>I&#39;m old and can&#39;t function!</q>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            While the elderly have more experience and insights in life, what designers don&#39;t seem to take into account are the physical changes they go through. Vision deteriorates. The lens of the eyes harden, making focusing more difficult. (small print, poor contrast issues). A flashlight has become an essential item, whether the one built into many phones or carried separately, because illumination makes a tiny type easier to read although even then, a magnifying glass might be useful. Hearing decreases. Comments about Apple's usability sins. Due to decline in hand-eye coordination,  small touch sensitive areas are harder to execute. Speech being a useful substitute for physical controls, but not being the same. Aesthetic problems that occur with existing designs for the elderly. They tend to be tacky and an unwanted signal of fragility. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not think that thoughtful design is just for the elderly, or the sick, or the disabled. In the field of design, this is called inclusive design for a reason: It helps everyone. Curb cuts were meant to help people who had trouble walking, but it helps anyone wheeling things: carts, baby carriages, suitcases. Closed captions are used in noisy bars. Almost anything that will help the elderly population will end up helping everyone.
