                    Some designers will make choices that reach millions of people and will endure for many years. If nothing else, I hope this book illustrates the weight of that privilege and opportunity.

                    Kat Holmes led Microsoft&#39;s program for inclusive product innovation from 2010 to 2017, and went on to work with Google and found her own firm, mismatch.design. Her book “Mismatch : How Inclusion Shapes Design” defines moments where design meets exclusion as moments of mismatched interaction. They&#39;re pretty easy to identify: ordering off a menu written in a foreign language, climbing onto a counter to reach a shelf, a blind child at a science museum touchscreen. Once we train ourselves to see exclusion, we can examine our own unconscious exclusion habits. Holmes says, 
                        <q>
                            Each time we remedy a mismatched interaction, we open an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways.

                    And when companies do design things specifically for the elderly, they tend to be ugly devices that shout out to the world “I&#39;m old and can&#39;t function!”. We can do better.

                    Donald Norman is a name every designer comes across time and again. He is a former VP of Apple, the director of The Design Lab at University of California, San Diego and co-founder and Principal Emeritus of Nielsen Norman Group. Much of Norman's work involves the advocacy of user-centered design. He has a complaint. He feels the world is designing against the elderly with everyday tasks becoming harder to accomplish. Norman talks about how taking into consideration the aged population is more important than ever as in spite of decline in senses, this market is highly active with more free time, experience and discretionary income than younger people. He highlights discrepancies caused due to decline in vision, hearing and hand-eye coordination. He believes that almost anything that will help the elderly population will end up helping everyone (iterating the need for inclusive design).

                    Cortney Cassidy is an artist using text, image, performance, and sound to write poetry. She studies horticulture at the New York botanical garden. Courtney points out how each of us perceive colors differently and that interpretation of light landing on a surface depends on your frame of reference and your frame of mind. Not every deviation from the norm must be a blindness. <q>If one says &#39;red&#39; and there are fifty people listening, it can be expected that there will be fifty reds in their minds</q> wrote the artist and educator Josef Albers. We see fifty different reds because we each perceive and experience color differently. People with decreased ability to differentiate between hues experience color through a series of judgments.
