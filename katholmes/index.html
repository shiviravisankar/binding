        How Inclusion Shapes Design
    </p>

        <h3>
            Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes designed objects reject their users, products and infrastructures designed by designers leave out entire populations who cannot use them. A computer mouse that doesn't work for left-handed people, or a touchscreen payment system that only works for people who read English phrases, have 20/20 vision, and use a credit card. People in wheelchairs for whom access to certain buildings is impossible. Similarly, racialized people are confronted with facial recognition systems that are set up to distinguish only white-skinned people.The small size of some women forces them to wear shoes in the children's department. Each of these examples is a <q>mismatch</q>, a design anomaly that deprives a group of people of the use of a product. From these mismatches comes a strong feeling of exclusion. How can we proceed to design and innovate in an inclusive way?
